# Bilingual Word Embeddings with Fewer Than 100 Data Samples! 

This project extends prior research to build **bilingual word embeddings** for the **Punjabi–Tamil** language pair — two linguistically distant languages from different language families. The goal is to support low-resource cross-lingual NLP without relying on large parallel corpora.

---

## Objective

To create high-quality bilingual embeddings for Punjabi and Tamil using a minimal-resource approach, enabling cross-lingual understanding and transfer in low-resource settings.

---

## Methodology

- **Custom Dictionary:**  
  Created a 1,000-word bilingual dictionary manually for Punjabi–Tamil alignment.

- **Embedding Strategy:**  
  Combined a **dictionary-based mapping** approach with a **self-learning refinement** step to improve embedding alignment without large datasets.
